      <p>
        Blueberry Hill Farm is located in Winterport, Maine and is family-owned and family-operated.  
        We specialize in raising high-quality miniature poodles.  
        We also have several contacts in our area for other breeds including 
        Golden Retrievers, Goldendoodles, Burnese Mountain, Yorkie, and Bison Frieze so please ask if you are interested.  
        Also check out our Facebook page for updates on our puppies and watch them grow and reach litter milestones.
        New puppy byers are able to follow along as their puppy learns and grows.
        Feel free to contact us there or to comment or to just hang out. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our farm not only raises loving, healthy, friendly puppies, but we also have strong ties to our community.
        When possible, we bring our puppies to visit the elderly as well as pre-schools in the area.
        It is a beautiful partnership that allows us both to meet a need in the local area and to socialize our puppies.
