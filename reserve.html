      <p>
If you are interested in a puppy but none are available, we offer two options:
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Put Down a Deposit</h3>

      <p>
Putting down a deposit will put you first in line for a puppy from the next available litter.
If multiple deposits are received for a litter, then puppies will be offered to buyers in the order that the deposits were received.
You are not obligated to pick from any specific litter, and you can always wait for a future litter, but please remember that deposits are non-refundable.
If we receive more deposits than there are puppies available, then puppies from a future litter will be offered.
Miniature poodles are small dogs and often have small litters so we sometimes limit the number of deposits that we accept at any given time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Join the Wait List</h3>

      <p>
If you are interested in a puppy from a future litter, but are not ready to put down a deposit, then you can ask to be added to our wait list.
If there are more puppies in a litter than we have received deposits for, then those on the wait list will be contacted on a first-come first-served basis after all those who put down a deposit have been contacted.
If you would like a puppy from that litter, then you must put down a deposit to reserve it.
If you are still not ready, then you can choose either to remain on the wait list or to be removed.
