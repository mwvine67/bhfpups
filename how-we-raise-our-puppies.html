      <p>
Our puppies are constantly being handled and snuggled by our family.  
With several grandchildren visiting often, the puppies become very comfortable around toddlers and younger children. 
Socialization both with people and with other dogs is an important part of their upbringing. 
      </p>

      <p>
Potty training begins with an indoor tray for indoor messes.
The tray aids in their own cleanliness as well as in keeping them and their area clean.
Once they begin weaning and eating regular meals, they start their outdoor training in earnest, and most of them catch on to it quickly.
This early training gives their new families a head start in house training their puppy when they go to their new home.

We keep up on their hygiene by cleaning them and their areas on a regular basis.
We make sure that all of our puppies are veterinary-checked and up-to-date on their shots and deworming and healthy before they are released to their new family.
